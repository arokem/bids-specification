# The Brain Imaging Data Structure

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a simple and intuitive way to
organize and describe data.

This document defines the BIDS specification, which provides all of the details
to implement the standard. It includes the core specification as well as many extensions
to specific brain imaging modalities, and increasingly also to other kinds of
data.

If BIDS is new to you, and you would like to learn more about how to adapt your
own datasets to match the BIDS specification, we recommend exploring the
[bids-specification starter kit](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit).
Alternatively, to get started please read [the introduction to the spec](01-introduction.md).

For an overview of the BIDS ecosystem, visit the [BIDS homepage](https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
The entire specification can also be [downloaded as PDF](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3686061).
